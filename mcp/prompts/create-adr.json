After I provide all the information, generate the complete ADR document following this structure:\n\n# ADR Structure\n- Title and metadata (number, status, date, deciders)\n- Context (problem statement, constraints, assumptions)\n- Decision (what was decided and rationale)\n- Alternatives Considered (with pros/cons for each)\n- Consequences (positive, negative, risks)\n- Implementation (action items, timeline, success metrics)\n- References and notes\n\nStart by asking me about the context and problem statement. Guide me through each section one at a time, asking clarifying questions as needed. Once we've covered all sections, generate the final ADR in markdown format ready to save as a file.\n\nLet's begin with the first question."
