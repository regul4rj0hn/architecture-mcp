Identify which patterns from our catalog are most relevant\n2. Explain why each suggested pattern is appropriate for this problem\n3. Describe how the pattern would be applied in this context\n4. Highlight any trade-offs or considerations for each pattern\n5. Recommend a primary pattern and any complementary patterns\n6. Provide a brief implementation approach using the recommended patterns\n\nFocus on patterns that are documented in our catalog and provide specific guidance on how to apply them."
