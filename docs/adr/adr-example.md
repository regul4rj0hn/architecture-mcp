- **Technical Story**: Sample Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Context and Problem Statement
Should software architects write code as a part of their day-to-day activities?

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: Architects should write code because it allows them to validate design decisions. Don't take my word for it, ask GPT!
By experiencing the ease or difficulty of implementing a part of a design in code and going through the SDLC, they gain a clear understanding of the effort required by engineers.

## Decision Drivers
- Validation of designs
- Relatability to engineers
- Continous learning
- Workload

## Considered Options
| Title                | Description                             | Pros                        | Cons                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Write Code**       | Architects should write code            | - Relatable to engineers <br> - Continous learning <br> - Full SDLC validation | - Takes more time |
| **Don't write Code** | Architects should not write code        | - More free time!           | - Lack of depth and breadth understading |
| **PoCs Only**        | Architects should only write non-production code or proof of concepts | - Quickly validate designs | - Does not validate SDLC |

## Consequences
If you are a sotware architect you should be doing a deep-dive
