## Context and Problem Statement
Describe the full context and state the problem that the decision should resolve or mitigate.

Characteristics of a good "Context" section in an ADR:
- Explain your organization's situation and business priorities.
- Include rationale and considerations based on social and skills makeups of your teams.
- Include pros and cons that are relevant, and describe them in terms that align with your needs and goals.

## Consequences
Characteristics of good "Consequences" section in an ADR:
- Explain what follows from making the decision. This can include the effects, outcomes, outputs, follow ups, and more.
- Include information about any subsequent ADRs. It's relatively common for one ADR to trigger the need for more ADRs, such as when one ADR makes a big overarching choice, which in turn creates needs for more smaller decisions.
- Include any after-action review processes. It's typical for teams to review each ADR one month later, to compare the ADR information with what's happened in actual practice, in order to learn and grow.
